Parameters

Parameters
Required parameters
part string
The part parameter specifies the caption resource parts that the API response will include. Set the parameter value to snippet.

The following list contains the part names that you can include in the parameter value:
id
snippet
Optional parameters
onBehalfOfContentOwner string
This parameter can only be used in a properly authorized request [https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/authentication].

Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.

The onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter indicates that the request's authorization credentials identify a YouTube CMS user who is acting on behalf of the content owner specified in the parameter value. This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and get access to all their video and channel data, without having to provide authentication credentials for each individual channel. The actual CMS account that the user authenticates with must be linked to the specified YouTube content owner.
sync boolean
This parameter has been deprecated. The sync parameter indicates whether YouTube should automatically synchronize the caption file with the audio track of the video. If you set the value to true, YouTube will disregard any time codes that are in the uploaded caption file and generate new time codes for the captions.

You should set the sync parameter to true if you are uploading a transcript, which has no time codes, or if you suspect the time codes in your file are incorrect and want YouTube to try to fix them.
