For Google Workspace organizations that use hardware key encryption, the Gmail API supports using smart cards for client-side encryption (CSE). For details, see the reference documentation for CseIdentity [https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/reference/rest/v1/users.settings.cse.identities] and CseKeyPair [https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/reference/rest/v1/users.settings.cse.keypairs] resources.

The messages.import method uses a more performant backend implementation. The new version is API-compatible with the previous implementation and all clients automatically started using the new behavior as of a few weeks ago. The new backend supports parallel message.import calls efficiently and clients can now import messages in parallel for a user to achieve higher migration throughput. The quota cost of the message.import method has been decreased to reflect the new performance.

POP and IMAP [https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides/pop_imap_settings]

February 25, 2016
The messages.batchDelete method [https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/users/messages/batchDelete] lets you delete multiple messages, by message IDs, in a single batch operation.
January 13, 2016
The drafts.list method [https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/users/drafts/list] has an includeSpamTrash option, which determines if the response should include drafts with the SPAM or TRASHlabel applied. The default is currently set to true for this option.
June 22, 2015
To determine the full state of an email before and after a change, the history.list method [https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/users/history/list] returns all current Message.labelIds as part of the response in messagesAdded, messagesDeleted, labelsAdded, and labelsRemoved.
June 18, 2015
Added a Message.internalDate field [https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/users/messages] that exposes the message's creation timestamp in the mailbox.
May 29, 2015
You can now send push notifications [https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides/push] on mailbox updates, providing real-time server notification without the need for constant polling. With Cloud Pub/Sub [https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/overview], you can now use webhooks—for example, to receive callbacks when updates happen. Additionally, you can filter these notifications to specific Gmail labels.
March 31, 2015
New scopes for labels and inserting messages to better protect users and accommodate apps that don't need full mailbox data access:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.insert: Allows the messages.insert [https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/users/messages/insert] and messages.import [https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/users/messages/import] methods only.
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.labels: Allows all label operations [https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/users/labels].
March 18, 2015
The messages.insert method [https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/users/messages/insert] now supports the deleted request parameter and lets you set SENT and DRAFT labels.
February 25, 2015
The history.list method [https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/reference/rest/v1/users.history/list] now provides details of the change type in each history record. For example, using the messagesAdded, messagesDeleted, labelsAdded, or labelsDeleted enums, it's possible to easily tell how a message was changed and typically avoids the need for additional calls to synchronize your client.
February 11, 2015
The messages.import method [https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/reference/rest/v1/users.messages/import] now supports the following parameters to better support Email Migration use cases:

processForCalendar
deleted
January 23, 2015
You can now specify message.labelIds on messages.import requests [https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/users/messages/import] to automatically apply the given labels to the message.
The default behavior no longer automatically adds INBOX and UNREAD labels to messages.import emails [https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/users/messages/import]. When message.labelIds isn't specified, imported mail is only visible in All Mail. If you want INBOX or UNREAD labels applied, specify them in the message.labelIds field.
January 15, 2015
Increased the default per-user quotas [https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/quota] from 25 units/user/second to 250 units/user/second and adjusted some method costs slightly.
October 22, 2014
You can now specify the return format for the threads.get method [https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/users/threads/get]. The available formats are full, metadata, and minimal, similar to the messages.get method. The raw format isn't allowed for the threads.get to avoid unexpectedly large amounts of data being returned.
October 16, 2014
The getProfile method [https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/users/getProfile] provides mailbox-wide information like current history ID and total message and thread counts.
October 06, 2014

Added new fields to the Labels resource to simplify counting how many messages have a given label applied:
messagesTotal
messagesUnread
threadsTotal
threadsUnread
September 25, 2014
The messages.insert method defaults to using receivedTime and the messages.import method defaults to using dateHeader.
September 08, 2014
When you use the messages.get method [https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/reference/rest/v1/users.messages/get], you can request the metadata return format to return only the email headers and metadata such as identifiers and labels.
September 02, 2014
You can specify the internalDateSource for both the messages.insert [https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/reference/rest/v1/users.messages/insert] and messages.import [https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/reference/rest/v1/users.messages/import] methods.
July 11, 2014
Quota costs for all methods in the API have been reduced by a factor of 10. For example, if a method previously cost 150 quota units, it now costs 15.
